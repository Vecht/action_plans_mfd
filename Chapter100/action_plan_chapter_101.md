Overview
===

3. Finish up sealing projects.

**Motivations**

**Assumptions**

* We have about three or four weeks left before the next mission.

Methods
===

**Scene One**

**Scene Two**: Project Zeppelin

* Goal: We want an easy, reliable, stealthy, and safe method of long distance travel.
  * Steps:
    * Bring up the idea with the team, including why it's useful.
      * Demonstrate a sky lantern from home.
      * Long distance travel that is easily sustained, fast, direct, and hard to detect.
      * Can potentially trade technolgoy with Leaf for favors
      
  * Supporting Information:
    * Zeppelins
  * Potential Issues:
    * Safety of being on a floating platforming with a fire overhead.
    * Possible detection of our research and development effort.
    * Lack of required raw material.
    
**Scene Three: Keiko's Gift**



**Scene Four: Noburi and Medic Training:**

* Goal: We want to help Noburi finish his medical training safely.
* Step:
  * Let Noburi know we are supportive of his ambitions as a medic-nin and that we want to help him on that path
  * Discuss potential issues, and how we might address them
  * Do NOT suggest Noburi should not go. Suggest that we should be extra cautious.
* Supporting Information:
  * Bring up Noburi disguising his barrel as a travel sack or appropriate covering.
    * Suggest Noburi obfuscate his movement through clever Henge use:
      * Noburi + Inoue go to Hashimoto's.
          * When Noburi leaves, Inoue creates a Water Clone Henge'd as Noburi.
          * Inoue & clone leave.
          * Repeat when Noburi leaves (at a set time?).
  * Ask Noburi what things Hashimoto might want (ryo, Macerators...) and offer to help with getting these things.
* Potential Issues  


Contingencies
===

* Interruption By Jiraiya
 * We should already be ready to move at all time.
