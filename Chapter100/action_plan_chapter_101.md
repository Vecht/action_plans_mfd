[X] Action Plan: Full of Hot Air

Overview
===

**Goal**

1. Finish up loose ends from chapter 100.
2. Address team issues as necessary.
3. Finish up sealing projects.

**Motivations**

**Assumptions**

* We have about three or four weeks left before the next mission.

Methods
===

**Scene One**: Project [S]Skyhopper[/S] Skywalker

* Goal: Finish developing the skywalker tech.
* Steps:
    * Develop a finished version in which adhesion activates the seal.
    * Test for Safety
      * Brainstorm with Kagome about how skywalkers might kill and maim us.
      * Test failure cases
        * May need captured animals for "demonstration" purposes.
        * Use clones for testing.
        * Some cases may include but not only: 
          * Falling really fast when activated.
          * One or both seals ceased to function.
          * Seals may be damaged during movement (e.g., through movement or substances in the atmosphere).
      * Outline safety protocols for using the skywalkers.
      * Develop solutions for failure cases, when applicable.
* Supporting Information:
* Potential Issues:
    * The team might not like animal cruelty.
    * Might take too long before the next mission/Keiko's birthday.


**Scene Two**: Project Zeppelin

* Goal: We want an easy, reliable, stealthy, and safe method of long distance travel.
* Steps:
    * Bring up the idea with the team, including why it's useful.
      * Remind the team of sky lanterns from back home.
      * Tell team ancedotes and inspirations, such as the jump.
      * Long distance travel that is easily sustained, fast, direct, and hard to detect.
      * Can potentially trade technology with Leaf for favors
    * Outline potential seals that could help out with the project.
* Supporting Information:
    * [Zeppelins](http://markedfordeath.wikia.com/wiki/Zeppelin)
* Potential Issues:
    * See the wiki article for some countermeasures and solutions that was proposed.
    * Safety of being on a floating platform with a fire overhead.
      * Tunneler's Friend could be used to store heat.
      * Develop a heating seal?
    * Possible detection of our research and development effort.
      * Do small prototypes and proof of concepts first before leaping on to a full-scale prototype.
    * Lack of required raw material.
      * Buy from shops in Yuni?
      
    
**Scene Three: Keiko's Gift**

* Goal: We want Keiko to have a happy birthday.
* Steps:
    * Ask Inoue-sensei for help getting Pandaa on board (she's the only one stealthy enough to talk to him without Keiko noticing).
    * Consider developing things for her:
      * Advanced PMYF Macerators with payloads (for smokebombs, flashbangs, pepper spray).
        * Note: We have to research making the Macerator seals with PMYF function.
      * Pangolin carving.
    * Get the team in on the plan.
* Supporting Information:
* Potential Issues
    * We might fuck things up. We probably will, somehow.
      * Talk to Inoue-sensei about Keiko's birthday first. Tell her our plan, make sure she agrees it won't fuck shit up.
    * We might get called in for a mission.
      * Make sure her birthday gifts are easy to give and won't be spoiled on the way.


**Scene Four: Noburi and Medic Training:**

* Goal: We want to help Noburi finish his medical training safely.
* Steps:
    * Let Noburi know we are supportive of his ambitions as a medic-nin and that we want to help him on that path
    * Discuss potential issues, and how we might address them
    * Do NOT suggest Noburi should not go. Suggest that we should be extra cautious.
* Supporting Information:
* Potential Issues
    * Hashimoto might not want to teach Noburi
      * Ask Noburi what things Hashimoto might want (ryo, Macerators...) and offer to help with getting these things.
    * Hunter-nin might notice Noburi and/or his barrel.
      * Bring up Noburi disguising his barrel as a travel sack or appropriate covering.
      * Suggest Noburi obfuscate his movement through clever Henge use:
        * Noburi + Inoue go to Hashimoto's.
          * When Noburi leaves, Inoue creates a Water Clone Henge'd as Noburi.
          * Inoue & clone leave.
          * Repeat when Noburi leaves (at a set time?).


Contingencies
===


* We should already be ready to relocate at any time. 
  * We should know where we are going to escape.
  * We should have enough seal blanks for escape + mission.
* Interruption By Jiraiya
* Interruption By Pangolins
* Interruption By Hunter-nins
