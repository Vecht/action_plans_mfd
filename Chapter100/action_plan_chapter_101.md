**Motivations**

**Assumptions**

* We have about three or four weeks left before the next mission.

Methods
===

**Scene One**: Project [S]Skyhopper[/S] Skywalker

* Goal: Finish developing the skywalker tech.
  * Steps:
    * Develop a finished version in which adhesion activate the seal.
    * Test for Safety
    * Implement solutions so that the Skywalker seals will fail last
    * Develop safety protocol for using the skywalker
  * Supporting Information:
    * Kagome and Hazou will brainstorm ways that the skywalker seal can main and kill users.
    * Clones will be used for testing.
    * Animal subjects may be procurred for "demonstration" purpose. 
      * Animals will be restrained and tied to the clone doing the testing.
      * Models for kind of injuries that might occur using failure mode.
    * Some Test Failure Cases
      * Falling at a fatal velocity before activation.
      * One of both seals ceased to function in midair(duration testing)
      * Using the skywalkers in bad weather.
    * Safety ideas:
      * Protective covering for the seals.
      * Extra Air Dome seals.
  * Potential Issues:
    * The team might not like animal cruelty.
    * They might think it's a waste of food.

**Scene Two**: Project Zeppelin

* Goal: We want an easy, reliable, stealthy, and safe method of long distance travel.
  * Steps:
    * Bring up the idea with the team, including why it's useful
    * Outline potential seals that could help out with the project.
    * If team approves, start working on the project.  
  * Supporting Information:
    * [Zeppelins](http://markedfordeath.wikia.com/wiki/Zeppelin)
    * Remind the team of festival lanterns that floated into the air.
    * Tell story about how Hazou achieved the jump.
    * Reasons why it is a good idea.
      * Make border crossing easier.
      * Can be used for long distance travel.
      * Open up trade for the merchant network and the elemental nations.
  * Potential Issues:
    * See the wiki article on the Zeppelin.
    * The team might be dismissive.
    * They might restrain Hazou from developing his idea.
      
    
**Scene Three: Keiko's Gift**



**Scene Four: Noburi and Medic Training:**

* Goal: We want to help Noburi finish his medical training safely.
* Step:
  * Let Noburi know we are supportive of his ambitions as a medic-nin and that we want to help him on that path
  * Discuss potential issues, and how we might address them
  * Do NOT suggest Noburi should not go. Suggest that we should be extra cautious.
* Supporting Information:
  * Bring up Noburi disguising his barrel as a travel sack or appropriate covering.
    * Suggest Noburi obfuscate his movement through clever Henge use:
      * Noburi + Inoue go to Hashimoto's.
          * When Noburi leaves, Inoue creates a Water Clone Henge'd as Noburi.
          * Inoue & clone leave.
          * Repeat when Noburi leaves (at a set time?).
* Potential Issues
  * Hashimoto might not want to teach Noburi
    *  Ask Noburi what things Hashimoto might want (ryo, Macerators...) and offer to help with getting these things.

Contingencies
===


* We should already be ready to relocate at any time. 
  * We should know where we are going to escape.
  * We should have enough seal blanks for escape + mission.
* Interruption By Jiraiya
* Interruption By Pangolins
* Interruption By Hunter-nins
