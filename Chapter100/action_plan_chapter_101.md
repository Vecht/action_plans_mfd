[X] Action Plan: Full of Hot Air

Overview
===

**Goal**

1. Finish up loose ends from chapter 100.
2. Address team issues as necessary.
3. Finish up sealing projects.

**Motivations**

**Assumptions**

* We have about three or four weeks left before the next mission.

Methods
===

**Scene One**: Project [S]Skyhopper[/S] Skywalker

* Goal: Finish developing the skywalker tech.
  * Steps:
    * Develop a finished version in which adhesion activate the seal.
    * Test for Safety
      * Brainstorm with Kagome about how skywalkers might kill and main us.
      * Test failure cases
        * May need captured animals for "demonstration" purpose.
        * Use clones for testing.
        * Some cases may include but not only: 
          * Falling really fast when activated.
          * One or both seals ceased to function.
      * Outline safety protocol for using the skywalker
      * Develop solutions to failure cases, when applicable
  * Supporting Information:
  * Potential Issues:
    * The team might not like animal cruelty.

**Scene Two**: Project Zeppelin

* Goal: We want an easy, reliable, stealthy, and safe method of long distance travel.
  * Steps:
    * Bring up the idea with the team, including why it's useful.
      * Remind the team of sky lanterns from back home.
      * Tell team ancedotes and inspirations, such as the jump.
      * Long distance travel that is easily sustained, fast, direct, and hard to detect.
      * Can potentially trade technolgoy with Leaf for favors
    * Outline potential seals that could help out with the project.
      
  * Supporting Information:
    * [Zeppelins](http://markedfordeath.wikia.com/wiki/Zeppelin)
  * Potential Issues:
    * See the wiki article for some countermeasures and solutions that was proposed.
    * Safety of being on a floating platforming with a fire overhead.
      * Tunneler's Friend could be used to store heat.
      * Develop a heating seal?
    * Possible detection of our research and development effort.
      * Do small prototypes and proof of concepts first before leaping on to a full-scale prototype.
    * Lack of required raw material.
      * Buy from shops in Yuni?
      
    
**Scene Three: Keiko's Gift**



**Scene Four: Noburi and Medic Training:**

* Goal: We want to help Noburi finish his medical training safely.
* Step:
  * Let Noburi know we are supportive of his ambitions as a medic-nin and that we want to help him on that path
  * Discuss potential issues, and how we might address them
  * Do NOT suggest Noburi should not go. Suggest that we should be extra cautious.
* Supporting Information:
  * Bring up Noburi disguising his barrel as a travel sack or appropriate covering.
    * Suggest Noburi obfuscate his movement through clever Henge use:
      * Noburi + Inoue go to Hashimoto's.
          * When Noburi leaves, Inoue creates a Water Clone Henge'd as Noburi.
          * Inoue & clone leave.
          * Repeat when Noburi leaves (at a set time?).
* Potential Issues
  * Hashimoto might not want to teach Noburi
    *  Ask Noburi what things Hashimoto might want (ryo, Macerators...) and offer to help with getting these things.

Contingencies
===


* We should already be ready to relocate at any time. 
  * We should know where we are going to escape.
  * We should have enough seal blanks for escape + mission.
* Interruption By Jiraiya
* Interruption By Pangolins
* Interruption By Hunter-nins
