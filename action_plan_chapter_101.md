**Goal**

**Scene Four: Noburi and Medic Training:**

* Do NOT suggest Noburi should not go. Suggest that we should be extra cautious.
* If Noburi thinks he should go to Yuni:
  * Bring up Noburi disguising his barrel as a travel sack or appropriate covering.
    * Suggest Noburi obfuscate his movement through clever Henge use:
      * Noburi + Inoue go to Hashimoto's.
          * When Noburi leaves, Inoue creates a Water Clone Henge'd as Noburi.
          * Inoue & clone leave.
          * Repeat when Noburi leaves (at a set time?).
  * Ask Noburi what things Hashimoto might want (ryo, Macerators...) and offer to help with getting these things.
